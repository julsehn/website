# 2D/3D Artist Looking for Commissions

## How it works
1. You will receive a DM from someone randomly
2. They act friendly and ask you about your day (Or something else)
3. They ask you for your favourite [insert item here]
4. They introduce themselves as a 2D/3D artist and ask if you would like to commission them
5. They ask for payment upfront
6. They block you after you pay them

    Scammers may also offer a discount on their art. Remember, if you are paying first, be cautious!

## I've already fallen for this scam
If you've already fallen for this scam, you should:
1. Report the user to [Discord Support](https://dis.gd/request)
2. Call your bank and ask for a chargeback
3. Block the user

## How do I avoid this scam?
- Don't accept random friend requests
- Artists will not usually ask for payment upfront
    - If they do, make sure to pay with a payment method that has buyer protection (Paypal Goods and Services)
<Callout type="error">
    DO NOT USE PAYMENT METHODS THAT YOU CANNOT REVERSE (Like Paypal friends and family)
</Callout>
- Artists normally do not ask you to commission them
- If you're unsure, ask for a portfolio
    - If they claim to be a professional, they should have a portfolio
    - If you're unsure, ask for references from previous clients
<Callout type="error">
    If someone has a portfolio, that does not mean to blindly trust them.
